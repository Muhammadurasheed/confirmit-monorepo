# ‚úÖ Journey 2 Enhancements Completed

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Hedera Explorer Link Fixed
**Problem:** "View on Hedera Explorer" button was leading to "Page Not Found"

**Root Cause:** Incorrect URL format in `hedera.service.ts`
- **Old format:** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7158192/serial/3`
- **Correct format:** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7158192/3`

**Fix Applied:** 
- Updated `backend/src/modules/hedera/hedera.service.ts` line 180
- Removed `/serial/` from the URL template
- Now generates proper HashScan URLs that work correctly

**Test:**
1. View any verified business profile with Trust ID NFT
2. Click "View on Hedera Explorer"  
3. Should open HashScan with correct NFT details

### 2. ‚úÖ "Other" Bank Option Added
**Problem:** User's friend was scammed via Renmoney and VFD banks - not in our database

**Solution:** Added "Other (Manual Entry)" option to bank selector

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/shared/BankSearchSelect.tsx`
- `src/components/features/account-check/AccountInputWithBankResolution.tsx`

**New Features:**
1. **Bank selector now includes:**
   - All existing Nigerian banks
   - **NEW:** "Other (Manual Entry)" option at the bottom (separated by border)

2. **When "Other" is selected:**
   - Shows manual text input field for bank name
   - User can type: "Renmoney", "VFD", or any unlisted bank
   - Skips Paystack account resolution (since unlisted banks aren't supported)
   - Shows warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è Account name cannot be auto-verified for unlisted banks"
   - Allows fraud report submission without account resolution

3. **Form validation:**
   - For listed banks: Requires Paystack account resolution
   - For "Other" banks: Only requires account number + manual bank name

**Test Cases:**
```
Scammer Account #1:
- Account: 3603101649
- Bank: Select "Other (Manual Entry)"  
- Bank Name: Renmoney
- Should allow check without account resolution

Scammer Account #2:
- Account: 1040950064
- Bank: Select "Other (Manual Entry)"
- Bank Name: VFD  
- Should allow check without account resolution
```
