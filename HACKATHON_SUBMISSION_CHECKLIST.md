## üéØ Final Reminders

‚úÖ **Deadline**: 31/10/2025 at 23:59 (Don't wait until the last minute!)

‚úÖ **Document Your Hedera Usage**: Judges want to see *how* and *why* you used Hedera

‚úÖ **Tell a Story**: Your README should explain the *problem*, not just the tech

‚úÖ **Test Everything**: Broken demos = lost points

Remember:
- You've built something meaningful
- Your code solves a real problem
- Hedera is the perfect fit for your solution
- The judges want you to succeed

**Now go submit and make Africa proud! üöÄüåç**
