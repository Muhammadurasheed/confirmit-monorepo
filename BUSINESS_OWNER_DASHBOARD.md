5. System fetches businesses where `created_by == user.uid`
6. If 1 business → auto-redirect to `/business/dashboard/:id`
7. If multiple → show selection screen
8. If none → show "Register Your Business" CTA

### Journey B: View Scan History
1. User scans receipt (authenticated or anonymous)
2. After analysis, result saved to Firestore/localStorage
