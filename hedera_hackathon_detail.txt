Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025
The Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 is a continent-wide innovation program co-organized by Exponential Science and The Hashgraph Association. Designed to mobilize Africa’s growing tech talent, the hackathon invites developers, students, startups, and innovators from around the globe to build impactful decentralized applications (dApps) on the Hedera network.

With $1 million in prizes, the hackathon aims to engage 10,000+ participants across 20+ African cities and online, driving real-world adoption of Web3 technologies.

🎯 Tracks & Challenges
Participants can choose from four tracks, each focused on applying Web3 tools to critical sectors using Hedera’s technology.

1. Onchain Finance & Real-World Assets (RWA): This track is about creating better financial tools using Hedera DLT. Participants can build apps for lending, borrowing, or sending fiat & crypto, especially for people who don’t have access to banks.They can also tokenize real world assets like houses, farms or rare material, so people can invest in them more easily. The goal is to make finance more open and fair for everyone in Africa.

2. DLT for Operations: This track focuses on using Hedera DLT to improve how things work in areas like healthcare, farming, and supply chains. For example, it can help keep patient records safe, track where food comes from, or make sure farmers get paid on time. It also supports eco-friendly ideas. The aim is to make these systems more transparent, secure, and efficient.

3. Immersive Experience: This track is for people who want to build fun and creative digital experiences. Developers can make games where players earn rewards, create virtual worlds, or design digital collectibles using NFTs. It’s also a space for community-driven tokens and online economies. The goal is to give users more control and ownership of their digital content.

4. AI & DePIN: This track combines artificial intelligence with decentralized systems. Participants can build smart apps that learn and improve over time, or create systems for things like energy, transport, or internet services that don’t rely on a central authority. The focus is on building smart, community-powered solutions that solve real-world problems.
