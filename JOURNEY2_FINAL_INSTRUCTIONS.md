# Journey 2: AccountCheck - Final Instructions

## 🎯 Overview
Journey 2 is now complete with intelligent demo/real data merging, fraud reporting, and NFT visibility.

---

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Seed Demo Data (Run ONCE)
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:demo
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 3 demo scam accounts with fraud reports
- Creates 3 demo verified businesses (for testing only)
- Data persists in Firestore permanently
- Only run again to reset/refresh

---

### 2️⃣ Add Your Friend's Scammer Account (REAL Data)
```bash
cd backend
```

**Edit `scripts/add-fraud-report.ts`:**
```typescript
const accountNumber = '0123456789'; // REPLACE
const bankCode = '044'; // REPLACE (e.g., 044 for Access Bank)
const businessName = 'Fake Electronics Store'; // REPLACE
const description = 'Your fraud story...'; // REPLACE
const amountLost = 150000; // REPLACE (in Naira)
const transactionDate = '2025-01-15'; // REPLACE (YYYY-MM-DD)
const reportedBy = 'Your Friend Name'; // REPLACE
const reporterEmail = 'friend@example.com'; // REPLACE
```

**Run:**
```bash
npm run fraud:add
```

**Result:**
- Adds scammer to REAL `accounts` collection
- Creates fraud report in REAL `fraud_reports` collection
- Account will show as HIGH RISK when searched

---

### 3️⃣ Mint NFTs for Existing Approved Businesses
```bash
cd backend
npm run nft:mint-existing
```

**What this does:**
- Finds all approved businesses without NFTs
- Mints Trust ID NFT for each on Hedera Testnet
- Updates business documents with NFT data
- Skips businesses that already have NFTs

**Important:** Verify Hedera credentials in `backend/.env`:
```env
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.7098369
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=302e020100...
HEDERA_TOKEN_ID=0.0.7131340  # Must exist!
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
```

---

## 🔍 Testing AccountCheck

### Test Scenario 1: HIGH RISK (Demo Scam Account)
```
Account Number: 0000123456
Bank Code: 044 (Access Bank)
```
**Expected:**
- ❌ Red danger card
- Trust Score: 0/100
- Risk Level: HIGH RISK
- 3 fraud reports displayed
- "View Fraud Reports" modal functional

---

### Test Scenario 2: VERIFIED BUSINESS (Your Real Approved Business)
```
Search with any approved business account from your database
```
**Expected:**
- ✅ Green success card
- Trust Score: 70-85/100
- Verified badge
- Business logo, name, rating
- "View Public Profile" button
- **Trust ID NFT Card** displayed (after running nft:mint-existing)

---

### Test Scenario 3: NO DATA (Unknown Account)
```
Account Number: 9999999999
Bank Code: Any
```
**Expected:**
- ⚪ Gray neutral card
- "No data available"
- Safety tips displayed
- Encouragement to report if scammed

---

### Test Scenario 4: MISMATCH (Requires Paystack Integration)
**Setup:**
1. Enter account number + bank code
2. Backend calls Paystack's `/bank/resolve` API
3. Compares returned name with stored business name

**Expected:**
- ⚠️ Yellow warning card
- "Name mismatch detected"
- Shows both names
- Security recommendations

---

## 🎨 NFT Visibility - How It Works

### When NFTs Are Minted:
1. **During Business Approval:**
   ```typescript
   // backend/src/modules/business/business.service.ts:289-310
   await hederaService.mintTrustIdNFT(businessId, name, trustScore, tier);
   ```

2. **Stored in Firestore:**
   ```typescript
   business.hedera = {
     trust_id_nft: {
       token_id: '0.0.7158192',
       serial_number: '#1',
       explorer_url: 'https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/...'
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Displayed on Frontend:**
   - **BusinessProfile.tsx** (Public profile)
   - **BusinessDashboard.tsx** (Owner dashboard)
   - **AccountCheck verified results**

### NFT Card Shows:
- 🎨 Visual NFT representation
- 🏆 Trust Score gauge
- 🔐 Verification tier badge
- 🏢 Business name
- 🔗 Link to Hedera explorer
- ✨ "Blockchain Verified" badge

---

## 🚀 Demo Strategy

### For Hackathon Demo:

**1. Show Scam Detection (Your Friend's Real Account):**
```bash
# After adding your friend's scammer account
Search in AccountCheck → Show HIGH RISK result → View Fraud Reports
```

**2. Show Verified Business (Your Real Business):**
```bash
# Use one of your approved businesses
Search in AccountCheck → Show VERIFIED result → Click "View Public Profile"
→ Show Trust ID NFT Card on profile
```

**3. Show NFT on Hedera Explorer:**
```bash
# Click "View on Hedera Explorer" button on NFT card
→ Shows blockchain transaction
→ Explains immutability and trust
```

**4. Show No Data (Unknown Account):**
```bash
Search: 9999999999 → Shows safety tips and report option
```

## 📊 Data Architecture

### Demo Data (For Testing):
- `demo_accounts` collection
- `demo_fraud_reports` collection
- `demo_businesses` collection
- `demo_reviews` collection

### Real Data (Production):
- `accounts` collection
- `fraud_reports` collection
- `businesses` collection (with hedera.trust_id_nft)
- `reviews` collection

### Backend Merging Logic:
```typescript
// accounts.service.ts:checkAccount()
1. Query both demo_accounts AND accounts
2. Prioritize demo data if exists
3. Otherwise use real data
4. Fetch associated fraud reports / business details
5. Return merged result
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### NFT Not Showing?
1. Check if business has `hedera.trust_id_nft` in Firestore
2. Run `npm run nft:mint-existing` to mint for existing businesses
3. Verify `HEDERA_TOKEN_ID` exists on Hedera Testnet
4. Check backend logs for NFT minting errors

### Fraud Report Not Showing?
1. Verify account hash matches (check console logs)
2. Ensure fraud report uses same `account_hash`
3. Check Firestore `fraud_reports` collection

### AccountCheck Shows Wrong Result?
1. Check backend logs for API errors
2. Verify Firestore indexes exist (see below)
3. Test with demo accounts first (0000123456)

---

## 🔥 Required Firestore Indexes

Create these indexes in Firebase Console:

### 1. fraud_reports
```
Collection: fraud_reports
Fields: account_hash (Ascending), created_at (Descending)
```

### 2. demo_fraud_reports
```
Collection: demo_fraud_reports
Fields: account_hash (Ascending), created_at (Descending)
```

### 3. reviews
```
Collection: reviews
Fields: business_id (Ascending), created_at (Descending)
```

### 4. demo_reviews
```
Collection: demo_reviews
Fields: business_id (Ascending), created_at (Descending)
```
