## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS TO ADDRESS

### Blocker #1: SDK Package Missing
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Judges will try to integrate via SDK and fail  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  

**Solution:**
Create minimal @legit/sdk package with:
- Receipt verification method
- Account checking method
- Webhook signature validation
- TypeScript types
- README with installation instructions

**Deliverables:**
- `sdk/` folder in monorepo
- `package.json` with name `@legit/sdk`
- `src/index.ts` with main methods
- `README.md` with usage examples
- Build script to compile to `dist/`

---

### Blocker #2: Real Usage Analytics
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Dashboard shows fake data, reduces credibility  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  

**Solution:**
- Update `UsageAnalytics.tsx` to fetch from Firestore
- Query `/businesses/{id}/api_usage` subcollection
- Aggregate by date for charts
- Show real API calls, success rates, response times

---

### Blocker #3: Webhook Management
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Feature mentioned but not accessible  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  

**Solution:**
- Create `WebhookManagement.tsx` component
- Add to Business Dashboard "Settings" tab
- UI to register webhook URLs
- Show webhook event types (receipt.analyzed, account.flagged, business.approved)
- Webhook logs table with retry button
- Test webhook with webhook.site

---

### Blocker #4: Public Business Profiles
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Directory links may 404  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  

**Solution:**
- Create `BusinessProfile.tsx` page (public view)
- Different from `BusinessDashboard.tsx` (owner view)
- Show: business info, trust score, verified badge, NFT, contact, reviews
- No sensitive info (API keys, analytics)
- Test route `/business/:id` works

---

### Blocker #5: Demo Video
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Required for submission  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  

**Solution:**
- Script 3-minute pitch (see template below)
- Screen record all 4 journeys
- Show Hedera integration prominently
- Add voiceover explaining AI + DePIN synergy
- Upload to YouTube (unlisted)
- Add subtitles
