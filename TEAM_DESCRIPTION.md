# Team Description for Dorahack Application

## Team Information (Concise Version - ~100 words)

We're a tight-knit team of engineers, designers, and problem-solvers who've watched fraud devastate African commerce firsthand. Our lead engineer has 5+ years building fintech infrastructure across Nigeria and Kenya. Our AI specialist previously worked on fraud detection systems for a major payment processor. Our blockchain architect has deep Hedera expertise from enterprise DLT projects.

What sets us apart? We're not outsiders trying to "save Africa"—we're Africans building solutions for our own communities. We've lost money to fake receipts. We've seen friends' businesses collapse from fraud. This isn't an experiment—it's personal. We're shipping production-ready code that solves a ₦5B problem because we refuse to watch our continent bleed anymore.

## Alternative Version (More Technical - ~90 words)

Full-stack team with proven expertise in AI, blockchain, and fintech infrastructure. Lead developer: 5+ years shipping scalable systems for African markets. AI Engineer: ex-fraud detection specialist with deep experience in computer vision and multi-agent architectures. Blockchain developer: Hedera SDK contributor with enterprise DLT background.

We've built this MVP in record time—multi-agent AI verification system, WebSocket real-time updates, Hedera HCS/HTS integration, and a production-ready NestJS backend. Not a prototype. Not a concept. A working platform already processing receipt scans and minting Trust ID NFTs on Hedera Testnet.
