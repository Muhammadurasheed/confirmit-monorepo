## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Backend (NestJS)
#### ✅ Enhanced Accounts Service

## 🔥 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Seed Demo Data
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:demo
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Seeded scam account: 0000123456 (Fake Electronics Hub) - 4 reports
✅ Seeded scam account: 1111234567 (Quick Deals NG) - 2 reports

✅ Seeded verified business: ChiTech Solutions (89 reviews, 4.5★)
✅ Seeded verified business: Legit Store Lagos (203 reviews, 4.9★)
```

### Step 2: Update AccountCheck Page
Replace the current simple results display with the new 4-outcome components in `src/pages/AccountCheck.tsx`:

```typescript
// Determine which result component to show
const renderResults = () => {
  if (!result) return null;

  const { data } = result;

  // HIGH RISK: Has fraud reports
  if (data.checks.fraud_reports.total > 0) {
    return (
      <HighRiskResult
        accountNumber={currentAccountNumber}
        trustScore={data.trust_score}
        fraudReports={data.checks.fraud_reports}
        checkCount={data.checks.check_count}
        proceedRate={data.checks.proceed_rate || 0.09}
        flags={data.checks.flags}
        onReportFraud={() => navigate('/report-fraud')}
      />
    );
  }

  // VERIFIED: Linked to verified business
  if (data.verified_business) {
    return (
      <VerifiedResult
        accountNumber={currentAccountNumber}
        trustScore={data.trust_score}
        business={data.verified_business}
        checkCount={data.checks.check_count}
        proceedRate={data.checks.proceed_rate || 0.87}
      />
    );
  }

  // NO DATA: Clean slate
  return (
    <NoDataResult
      accountNumber={currentAccountNumber}
      checkCount={data.checks.check_count}
      onReportFraud={() => navigate('/report-fraud')}
      onRequestVerification={() => navigate('/business/register')}
    />
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Test All 4 Outcomes
1. **HIGH RISK:** Enter `0000123456` with bank `044` (Access Bank)
2. **VERIFIED:** Enter `0123456789` with bank `044` (Access Bank)
3. **NO DATA:** Enter `1234567890` with any bank
4. **MISMATCH:** (Requires Paystack integration for real-time name checking)

### Step 4: Firestore Indexes
Required indexes for production (create in Firebase Console):

```
Collection: demo_fraud_reports
├── account_hash (Ascending) + reported_at (Descending)

Collection: fraud_reports
├── account_hash (Ascending) + reported_at (Descending)

Collection: demo_reviews
├── business_id (Ascending) + created_at (Descending)

Collection: reviews
├── business_id (Ascending) + created_at (Descending)

Collection: businesses
├── account_number_hash (Ascending) + verification_status (Ascending)
```
